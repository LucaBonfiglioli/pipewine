You are free to ask anything in whatever format you like. Keep in mind that:

- Everyone's time is a limited resource. Make sure to ask valid questions that are not already answered by the documentation. Otherwise, [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)!
- Bug reports will receive a higher priority than questions.
