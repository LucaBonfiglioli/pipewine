## Bug Description
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## System
 - OS:
 - Python: 
 - Pipewine version: 
 - Environment:
   ```
   [run `pip freeze > env.txt` and copy-paste the contents of `env.txt` here]
   ``` 
 - If relevant, feel free to add additional system data. E.g. in a CLI-related question, knowing the shell type and version could help.

## Steps to Reproduce
Provide a minimal list of instructions to reproduce the bug. Bugs that cannot be reproduced won't be fixed.

Keep it short! Once you observe a bug, do the following:
1. Isolate the bug: create a self-contained separate program that consistently reproduces the bug.
2. Remove stuff from your program until the bug cannot be reproduced anymore.
3. Copy-paste below the smallest code snippet that still reproduces the bug.

```python
# buggy_program.py
```

## Observed Behavior
What is the outcome of the buggy program? 

## Expected Behavior
What would be the output of the program if the bug weren't there?
You can omit this section in case of crashes.
